# DAREit 
### 

DAREit **(Developing & Acquiring Real Education in Information Technology)** is one of my pet project that sprang up due to the gap I’ve seen in Information Technology among up coming developers, Youth desiring to learn and children generating rapidy interest in IT but who does not possess the skills or finance to push them to the right edge. I for one was in such a predicament until I decided to do something about my state. I saw in a post somewhere (can’t remember the place) where it reads “If you are having a problem with your state, either change it or fix it”. So I decided to do both. Change and Fix (CnF). DAREit is my CnF solution system that uses what I termed _**“Alternative Technology”**_ to teach, educate, inspire and develop minds to explore the power of the Web and Information technology as a whole. More details about this new born initiative will soon be made known. meanwhile if you have an Old computer or a Laptop you can donate it to me. You will be greatly appreciated. Follow me on twitter (@ccemenike).
