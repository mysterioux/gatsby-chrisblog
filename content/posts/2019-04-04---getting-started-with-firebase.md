# GOOGLE FIREBASE
One of the recent platform i've been utilizing is Google Firebase. Its one of the best "free hosting" solution to host static files like html, javascript, CSS etc. Its my quick solution in hosting static applications. It's light, fast, provides content delivery throught the globe and why students,s tartups and bloggers should leverage on it.

## **FIREBASE WHAT?** 
--
Firebase is more than just a hosting platform. It's a whole suites of the best of google on one roof. According to wikipedia, **Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014. As of October 2018, the Firebase platform has 18 products, which are used by 1.5 million apps.**

Ok! Enough English, what is it? Huh! you still asking? Let's break it down a little:

* It is a Backend-as-a-Service
* First known in (YC S11)
* Used to have this logo ![firebase](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/948936/y8ssrQ4wMQYuZNCBU5Lt9-F2Dzk/firebasebrandingr4final.png)
* Now part of Google Cloud Infrastructure with a new look ![firebase](https://firebase.google.com/_static/fb352e1c8c/images/firebase/lockup.png)

Satisfied?

## **Implementation Path**
---
Google provides all that is needed to get your feet wet. In summary this is what they proposed:

* Install the firebase Cli (make sure you have nodejs installed). visit [nodejs](nodejs.org) to download nodejs
* Setup a project directory
* Deploy your site

## **How to get started properly**
---
Honestly no better place to get this information then to visit [How to get started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart)

Trying to give you what has been provided already is what I call **REPITITOIN OF DOCS (RoD)**

And in programming/development we try not to DRY (**Don't Repeat Yourself**) things
## Pros & Cons
---
The good news is that firebase is great, the bad news is that it's designed by humans who must get paid. Sorry, but it cannot be all roses

Let's see the good part

**_Pros_**

    Email & password, Google, Facebook, and Github authentication
    Realtime data
    Ready-made api
    Built in security at the data node level
    File storage backed by Google Cloud Storage
    Static file hosting
    Treat data as streams to build highly scalable applications
    Don’t worry about your infrastructure!

**_Cons_**

    Limited query abilities due to Firebase’s data stream model
    Traditional relational data models are not applicable to NoSQL; therefore, your SQL chops will not transfer
    No on-premise installation





   That's been said, head over to [Firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com) and explore.
