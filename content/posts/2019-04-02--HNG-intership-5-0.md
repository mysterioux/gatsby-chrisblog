description: "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step so said the philosophers. HNG Intership 5.0 is one of those steps I decided to be part. Learning as much as I can with limited resources here in Liberia is hectic but success doesn't give excuses or does he? So I jumped in to see what the fuzz about this program is all about. "

I saw a post on twitter earlier this week about an Intership Program organized by Hotels.ng called [**HNG Intership**](https://hng.tech). It seems this program has been on for some time and I was not aware of it. So I decided to be part of this year edition. So far, its quite challenging mixing my 8-5pm work shift but kind of rewarding as I am always looking for ways to push myself to the my limit.

Starting with a creating a repo from github and doing some commits was the first step that was encouraged by the admin. I think I will copy this process for my tech community to get involved with development. Then we were assigned to create a mockup page using [**Figman**](https://www.figma.com) and online tool for designing mockups. You can take a pick of mockup, [see design here](https://www.figma.com/file/TZ7gEzt687GA0ljM8yaM9BsY/Personal-Page)

This is what I did, it's a start:

Today is my second day of learning and we were givine a task 
to find a bug from [Tumblr](https://timbu.com/) and [Verify.ng](https://www.verifi.ng/)

Let's see how it goes.
