## THE CHALLENGE

Finding out exactly what is needed to become successful is the first step in actualizing any dream. So for me its **TIME**. It seems TIME is running at a speed I cannot control or meetup. So I am postulating a plan to utilize my time by timing everything I do including eating, talking or chating with a friend. Second challenge is **FUNDS**. I know getting cash to push any actions is highly needed in any endeavours in life. But what can I do in exchange of cash? This is the principle I have come to follow

## NEXT MOVE

Your next move is getting the needed resources that would be essential in fulfilling the desire path that you hope to achieve. My goal is to reach a stable financial figure that would cater for a lot of needs. I have access to essential resources which will propel me forward to the next leave. I have stipulated a 3 months goal in order to attend these skills set. Some set required confirmation of learning through certifications, orders require building stuff as evidence that I have the right skills to quickly become productive. The cards is in my hand. My next move is to play it.
